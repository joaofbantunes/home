Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Antunes and I'm a tech professional who's always trying to push things forward. Interested in everything related to the software development process, including the development itself, solutions architecture, as well as other activities, like promoting technical discussions, knowledge sharing and helping colleagues level up.

I've worked across different projects and industries, developing (micro)services, web applications, IPTV applications and a bunch of other stuff. When developing, I've mainly focused on backend systems but always trying to keep an eye on what's going on in the frontend.

In terms of tech stack, my main focus has been .NET and C#, but I've worked with other technologies and enjoy trying and learning new things as much as possible.

I spend a good amount of time trying to keep up and learn new things, not only to improve on subjects relevant to my day-to-day job, but also exploring subjects that arenâ€™t (at least yet) part of it, so I improve my knowledge breadth, and have a bigger picture view when itâ€™s relevant.

I have a blog and a YouTube channel (you can find both in the homepage links) where I talk about all things software development. I also do occasional presentations at meetups, conferences and related events.

Big remote work supporter, as I believe the tech industry is in a privileged position to provide the best work-life balance, skipping unneeded commutes and relocations, while also being an example to the other industries.

Outside the programming world, I'm a bit of gadget addict, headbanger (didn't you notice something familiar about the blog title?) and am found regularly ranting about something ðŸ™‚

Feel free to reach out through one of the various socials linked in the home page (I'm more active on Mastodon and LinkedIn), I'm always open for a chat.
If you work in tech, or aspire to, feel free to reach out if you'd like some advice, discuss a topic I know about, need to be introduced to someone I know, or just think I can help you out with something, I'll do my best.

Since 2019, I've been awarded as a Microsoft MVP, in the developer technologies category.
