Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is JoÃ£o Antunes and I'm an experienced tech professional who's always trying to push things forward.

Interested in everything related to software development, from understanding the problem that needs solving, to the solution that needs building, the architecture and infrastructure to support the needs, the code that will make things happen, not forgetting the ways of working that will drive the process. Additionally, I also try my best to push others to level up, by promoting technical discussions, knowledge sharing, or simply by being available for a chat.

Over the years, I've worked across different projects and industries, building (micro)services, web applications, IPTV applications and a bunch of other stuff.

If you feel like reading something, I have a blog (you can find the link in the homepage) where I talk about all things software development. I also do occasional presentations at meetups, conferences and related events.

I'm a big remote work supporter, and I believe the tech industry is in a privileged position to be an example to other industries, showing that we can achieve great things without forcing people to waste time in unneeded commutes or to live in overcrowded and overpriced cities. In summary, remote work allows people to do their best work while living their best lives.

Outside the programming world, I'm a bit of gadget addict, headbanger (did you notice something familiar about the blog title?) and am found regularly ranting about something ðŸ™‚

Feel free to reach out through one of the various socials linked in the home page (I'm more active on Mastodon and LinkedIn), if you believe I help out with something, like to discuss a topic I know about or need to be introduced to someone I know, I'll do my best.

Since 2019, I've been awarded as a Microsoft MVP, in the developer technologies category.
