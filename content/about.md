Hey folks! 👋

My name is João Antunes and I am a seasoned technology professional focused on moving both systems and teams forward.

My experience covers the entire software development lifecycle, from initial problem discovery and system architecture, to infrastructure and organizational processes.

Over the years, I've worked across different projects and industries, building distributed applications based on (micro)services, web applications and even IPTV applications.

If you feel like reading something, I have a blog (you can find the link in the homepage) where I talk about all things software development. I also do occasional presentations at meetups, conferences and related events.

As a long-time advocate for remote work, I believe that high-trust cultures, with a mix of asynchronous and synchronous interactions, are the most effective way to build software, by focusing on results rather than presence.

Outside the programming world, I'm a bit of gadget addict, headbanger (did you notice something familiar about the blog title?) and am found regularly ranting about something 🙂

Feel free to reach out through one of the various socials linked in the home page (I'm more active on Mastodon, Bluesky and LinkedIn), if you believe I can help out with something, like to discuss a topic I know about or need to be introduced to someone I know, I'll do my best.

Since 2019, I've been awarded as a Microsoft MVP, in the developer technologies category.
